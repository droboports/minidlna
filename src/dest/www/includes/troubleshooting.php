<p><strong>My DLNA device cannot play some media file from <?php echo $appname; ?>. Either the file is not listed or playback fails.</strong></p>
<p>To decrease system load, <?php echo $appname; ?> does not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding" target="_new">transcode</a> on the fly unsupported media files into supported by your player formats. <?php echo $appname; ?> might not correctly identify whether certain formats are supported by your player, which may play via UPnP a broader formats choice. DLNA standard is quite limiting UPnP subset in media containers and codec profiles allowed.</p>
<p>If you do not see on TV screen or cannot play some media files listed in <?php echo $appname; ?>, try to copy that file on a USB drive, plug that drive in the DLNA device, and playing directly from there. If the file format is not supported natively, then it won't be supported trough <?php echo $appname; ?>.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot perform some playback function when using my DLNA device with <?php echo $appname; ?>.</strong></p>
<p><?php echo $appname; ?> might not support choosing audio tracks, subtitles, disk chapters, list sorting, and other advanced playback features for your player model.</p>
